# Overview

Purpose of this project implement 2-layer Neural Network from scratch using Numpy library.

# Data

Original data came from here: [http://www.ats.ucla.edu/](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/)

Dataset file located in `./data/student_data.csv` file. 

File contains 4 columns:

- admit
- gre
- gpa
- rank

# Work description

During my work on that project I have learned how to:

- Load data using Pandas library
- Plot data using MatPlotLib
- Scale data and prepare categorical data for feeding to Neural Network
- Implement feedforward process
- Calculate loss of Neural Network output
- Backpropagate the error and update weights
